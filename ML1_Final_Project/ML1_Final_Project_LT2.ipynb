    "F1 is one of if not the most prestigious motorsports competition in the world where 20 drivers from 10 different teams race against each other at speeds reaching 370kph throughout the year to determine who is the best driver and which team is the best in terms of car performance, strategy, etc. In the motorsports industry, F1 earned $3.65 billion in revenue in 2024, which is 25% more than what they earned in the previous year. This revenue comes from race promotion fees, media rights, sponsorships, and other sources such as high-margin hospitality, support series, and merchandise. Out of all these revenue streams, media rights contribute the most in annual revenue (32.8%) in the form of lucrative broadcasting agreements with major global networks and digital streaming services in partnership with Netflix’s Drive to Survive television series. Close to F1, much like many other globally-renowned sports, is sports betting. Sports betting is a highly lucrative market projected to reach $17.23 billion dollar in revenue in 2025. Of which, F1 makes up 0.4% of the global betting handle."

    "With these figures in mind, the teams, as well as sports bettors, stand to gain a lot from determining whether a driver and their car would win a race or not. To elaborate, teams would be able to determine when their car and driver are performing poorly, which would allow them to make the necessary adjustments as early as at the end of practice sessions or as late as at the end of qualifying(race before race to determine starting position of a car and driver in the actual race). As for bettors, people would want to know which driver-car duo has the highest probability of winning to make the right bets. Whether it's an F1 team or simply a bettor, the goal is ultimately to win. For an F1 team, winning means more prize money, and increased merchandise and car sales especially for car brands associated with teams.\n",

    "This study was also inspired by the work of Katelyn Castillo, Christopher Nash Jasmin, Jhedson Angelo Petilo, and Louie Sangalang from the MSDS 2025 cohort whose final project for DMW1 last year generated a driver performance index, which quantifies the performance of F1 drivers. The team wanted to include other factors that influence race results such as car/team performance and track difficulty as a way of continuing their work. THis section was included specifically to acknowledge the contribution of Kate and Nash's team to the current study. "

    "In order to train machine learning models to predict F1 race finishes, data was collected from 3 different sources namely: FastF1/Ergast API, F1 Official Website, and Kaggle. The FastF1 python package facilitates webscraping through the FastF1 API and Ergast API for data such as telemetry, lap times, race results, etc. As for the F1 Official Website, data pertaining to historical constructor's points and driver points were collected from here. Lastly, historical data about race track incidents and reasons for the incidents were collected from Kaggle. Once data from the 3 sources were collected, these were consolidated for analysis and modelling."
