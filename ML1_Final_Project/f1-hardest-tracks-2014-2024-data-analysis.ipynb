    "### Analysis Summary\n",
    "The focus of this analysis is to gain insights into which tracks are the hardest on both the driver and car in Formula One (F1). The variables used to conduct this analysis are based on the cause of DNF (did not finish) from every race spanning from 2014 to 2024. We will also discuss any elements the identified tracks share to determine if there are set factors that make a race track difficult.\n",
    "Data was downloaded from Kaggle that in turn was sourced directly from Formula One. Using SQl the data was cleaned and transformed before being transferred into tableau to create visuals. \n",
    "The main patterns identified were:\n",
    "- Tracks featuring early in the season or located in harsher climates (e.g., hotter temperatures or higher altitudes) were harder on the cars. These tracks produced more mechanical or physical fault DNFs than any other\n",
    "- Street circuits with limited space and tracks that promote more wheel-to-wheel racing were harder for the drivers. These races led to higher rates of collisions and DNFs due to driver error.\n",
    "- Reliability issues were more common at the beginning of new regulatory eras, where teams were adapting to significant technical changes.\n"

    "### Data Overview\n",
    "The dataset used in this analysis was downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020). This dataset was sourced directly from official Formula One records. Four data tables were downloaded and joined to conduct the analysis:\n",
    "- Results – Each individual race entry, including finishing position, coded result status, and related race information\n",
    "- Circuits – Each unique circuit with its corresponding ID and location\n",
    "- Races – Every race with a unique ID, associated Circuit ID, and general race details\n",
    "- tatus Key – A translation table converting coded result statuses into readable text\n",
    "\n",
    "As Formula One has been active since 1950, I chose to focus on the most recent decade (2014–2024). There were two main reasons for this: first, reliability has become a much more critical focus for teams in recent years; and second, this period aligns with when I began following the sport as a fan, making the context more personally relevant and easier to interpret.\n"

This issue became apparent when attempting to upload the dataset to BigQuery using the autodetect schema option, which flagged schema mismatches. These string entries were primarily due to coded status values that required translation using the status key table. Rather than forcing these into integer format prematurely, I kept the values as strings, to be formatted properly, and then used this to create a new, cleaner version of the table.\n",

    "I added a count to the graph to make it easier to gauge the percentage that each race result contributes to each track’s total. As a proportion of all race outcomes, the three tracks most frequently associated with mechanical or physical faults were Australia, Austria, and Bahrain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bahrain has long been notorious for placing strain on cars due to extreme heat. Australia, a street circuit, presents its own challenges for both drivers and cars—narrow sections, close barriers, and unpredictable weather conditions during that time of year all contribute to its difficulty. Australia and Bahrain often feature as the first or early season races, when teams are still fine-tuning their cars and gathering performance data, making mechanical failures more likely. The Austrian Grand Prix circuit is a fast track and sits at the highest altitude of all the European races. This adds complexity when balancing cooling and aerodynamic performance, and if not optimised, can lead to mechanical issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "The three tracks with the highest number of collisions are the British Grand Prix, with 0.39% of all race starts ending in a DNF due to collision, followed by Monaco (0.28%) and Brazil (0.26%). Both the British and Brazilian circuits promote intense wheel-to-wheel racing and are also known for unpredictable weather, creating ideal conditions for collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other tracks that encourage close racing, such as China, Russia, Spain, and the United States Grand Prix in Texas, also recorded over 0.2% of DNFs caused by collisions.\n",
    "Interestingly, Monaco ranks third despite being known for limited overtaking opportunities, suggesting that both tightly contested tracks and narrow street circuits contribute to higher collision rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to driver-induced accidents, Monaco stands out as the only track where over 0.3% of results ended in a DNF due to an accident. This is followed by Singapore and Belgium, both at 0.17%. All three are considered particularly demanding circuits.\n",
    "Monaco is known for its tight layout and minimal margin for error. Singapore shares many of these characteristics but adds the extreme heat and humidity, which can lead to driver fatigue and errors. Finally, Belgium presents it's own challenges due to its fast, demanding sections and complex layoutBelgium presents a different challenge, with fast, flowing sections and a technically demanding layout.\n"

    "Regarding collisions, 2018 and 2021 stand out, with both years recording 0.5% of all race results ending in a collision. The data does not suggest a clear reason for this. In 2021, car reliability was generally higher, meaning more cars remained in the race for longer periods—increasing the likelihood of collisions. However, 2018 does not follow this trend. This is likely due to the highly competitive nature of the season and how closely matched the teams were in terms of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the first four years under the 2014 regulation changes (2014–2017), mechanical or physical faults accounted for approximately 2.5%–3% of total race results each year. The 2014 season marked a major shift, with hybrid technology introduced to Formula One for the first time. In 2018, the number of mechanical or physical faults declined but remained relatively high. From there, it continued to decrease until 2021. In 2022, the frequency of these faults spiked again due to another significant regulatory overhaul. The aerodynamic rules were revised, and the cars became larger, heavier, and operated very differently from their predecessors. This presented new challenges for many teams. After the first season under these new regulations, the number of mechanical or physical faults began to decline once more. The trend line for these DNFs in the following graph strongly supports this pattern.\n",

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hardest Tracks On The Cars\n",
    "Austria, Australia, and Bahrain stood out as the most demanding tracks for the cars. The main contributing factors appear to be climate conditions (such as altitude and temperature), as well as their position in the season calendar—with earlier races showing a higher frequency of mechanical faults.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hardest Tracks For The Drivers\n",
    "The infamous Monaco street circuit takes pole position as the toughest track for drivers, despite being the slowest on the calendar. It is the only circuit to appear in the top three for both collisions and driver error–induced accidents. Other challenging tracks include the British, Brazilian, Singapore, and Belgian Grands Prix. This group features three fast, “racey” circuits and two tight, technical street tracks. The Dutch Grand Prix also deserves special mention for having the highest average positions lost, making it particularly difficult for drivers to hold position.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Yearly Patterns\n",
    "Across DNFs caused by collisions or driver errors, no clear year-on-year trend emerges. Since the calendar remains relatively consistent, the only significant variable is the level of competitiveness between drivers and teams in each season. However, a clear pattern does emerge in relation to regulation changes: at the start of a new regulatory era, there is typically a spike in DNFs caused by mechanical or physical faults.\n"
